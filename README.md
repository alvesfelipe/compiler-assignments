# Compiler Assignments

This repository is responsible for implement all assignments of compiler subject. Each directory called AT-taskNumber implements a specific assignment.

### AT-04

This assignment aims to implement a deterministic finite state machine [DFSM] for recognize a specific string.
In your directory, have a image that represents the automaton.

[DFSM]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton>

### lexical-analyzer

This implementation refers to a lexical parser of any Pascal code. The output is a table that contains: token | Token label | line.
